### ðŸ‘‹ Hi there, it's me

ðŸ”­  I'm currently cofounder CTO at [Hearts Radiant](https://heartsradiant.com). Our first product is [Rosita App](http://rositalongevity.com/), an AI longevity coach for seniors.

And now some vanity stats. They're wildly innacurate though, most of my work happens in private repos - no dart, no python, no ML, no typescript, no java (yikes) ...

And more vanity fun, just because I like to be called _Ancient_:

You may want to browse through my profile for open source contributions, to get a better picture: 

- I am the maintainer of some small ruby gems. I am glad to see [validates_zipcode](https://github.com/dgilperez/validates_zipcode) has being of use for many over the years.
- Some made it to Rails core once! ðŸ¤— 
- Most of the code is private ntl.
